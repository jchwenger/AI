    "Artificial intelligence is mechanical thought. Thinking machines, machines that do things that, until they did them, we thought only humans could do. As soon as machines accomplish a task we move the goal posts. They're not so clever after all, we say. Skill at chess was believed to be the apex of human thought; now machines dominate Chess and even Go, a far more complex game. "

Therefore I will get wet. Although the logic calculus is an aspect of thinking, it is not all of thinking; it fails miserably for tasks with undefinable rules such as image classification - is this a dog or a cat? - or speech recognition - Alexa, when is the next train to London?"
