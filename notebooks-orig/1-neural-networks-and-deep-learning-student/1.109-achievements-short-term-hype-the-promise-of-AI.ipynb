    "1960s: the era of symbolic AI. 1970s: an AI ‘winter’. This was a period of disappointment. Practical results were poor and funding dried up. There was an AI revival in the 1980’s with the development of expert systems but the weather chilled and the world entered another AI winter in the 1990s. Then, in the 2010s, the second coming of neural networks, now manifest as deep learning. The technology spread quickly and AI and deep learning - mystically reported in the media as 'algorithms' - is everywhere, or almost everywhere. It’s certainly in your pockets right now. The prophets of doom speak of the rise of the algorithm, but algorithms are neither autonomous or moral. What does the future hold?"
